A DuckDB extension for reading and writing Google Sheets with SQL.

_Note: This project is not affliated with Google or DuckDB, it is a community extension maintained by [Evidence](https://evidence.dev)._

## Install

```sql
INSTALL gsheets FROM community;
LOAD gsheets;
```

The latest version of [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/docs/installation) (currently 1.1.3) is supported.

## Usage 

### Authenticate

```sql
-- Authenticate with Google Account in the browser (default)
CREATE SECRET (TYPE gsheet);

-- OR create a secret with your Google API access token (boring, see below guide)
CREATE SECRET (
    TYPE gsheet, 
    PROVIDER access_token, 
    TOKEN '<your_token>'
);

-- OR create a non-expiring JSON secret with your Google API private key 
-- (This enables use in non-interactive workflows like data pipelines)
-- (see "Getting a Google API Access Private Key" below)
CREATE SECRET (
    TYPE gsheet, 
    PROVIDER private_key, 
    FILENAME '<path_to_JSON_file_with_private_key>'
);
```

### Read

```sql
-- Read a spreadsheet by full URL
FROM read_gsheet('https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11QdEasMWbETbFVxry-SsD8jVcdYIT1zBQszcF84MdE8/edit');

-- Read a spreadsheet by full URL, implicitly
FROM 'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11QdEasMWbETbFVxry-SsD8jVcdYIT1zBQszcF84MdE8/edit';

-- Read a spreadsheet by spreadsheet id
FROM read_gsheet('11QdEasMWbETbFVxry-SsD8jVcdYIT1zBQszcF84MdE8');

-- Read a spreadsheet with no header row
SELECT * FROM read_gsheet('11QdEasMWbETbFVxry-SsD8jVcdYIT1zBQszcF84MdE8', headers=false);

-- Read a sheet other than the first sheet using the sheet name
SELECT * FROM read_gsheet('11QdEasMWbETbFVxry-SsD8jVcdYIT1zBQszcF84MdE8', sheet='Sheet2');

-- Read a sheet other than the first sheet using the sheet id in the URL
SELECT * FROM read_gsheet('https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11QdEasMWbETbFVxry-SsD8jVcdYIT1zBQszcF84MdE8/edit?gid=644613997#gid=644613997');
```

### Write

```sql
-- Write a spreadsheet from a table by spreadsheet id
COPY <table_name> TO '11QdEasMWbETbFVxry-SsD8jVcdYIT1zBQszcF84MdE8' (FORMAT gsheet);

-- Write a spreadsheet from a table by full URL
COPY <table_name> TO 'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11QdEasMWbETbFVxry-SsD8jVcdYIT1zBQszcF84MdE8/edit?usp=sharing' (FORMAT gsheet);

-- Write a spreadsheet to a specific sheet using the sheet id in the URL
COPY <table_name> TO 'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11QdEasMWbETbFVxry-SsD8jVcdYIT1zBQszcF84MdE8/edit?gid=1295634987#gid=1295634987' (FORMAT gsheet);
```

## Getting a Google API Access Token

To connect DuckDB to Google Sheets via an access token, youâ€™ll need to create a Service Account through the Google API, and use it to generate an access token:

1. Navigate to the [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library).
2. Create a new project.
3. Search for the Google Sheets API and enable it.
4. In the left-hand navigation, go to the **Credentials** tab.
5. Click **+ Create Credentials** and select **Service Account**.
6. Name the Service Account and assign it the **Owner** role for your project. Click **Done** to save.
7. From the **Service Accounts** page, click on the Service Account you just created.
8. Go to the **Keys** tab, then click **Add Key** > **Create New Key**.
9. Choose **JSON**, then click **Create**. The JSON file will download automatically.
10. Download and install the [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).
11. Run the following command to login to the gcloud CLI with the Service Account using the newly created JSON file
    ```bash
    gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file /path/to/key/file
    ```
12. Run the following command to generate an access token:
    ```bash
    gcloud auth print-access-token --scopes=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets
    ```
13. Open your Google Sheet and share it with the Service Account email.
14. Run DuckDB and load the extension

This token will periodically expire - you can re-run the above command again to generate a new one.

## Getting a Google API Access Private Key

Follow steps 1-9 above to get a JSON file with your private key inside.

Include the path to the file as the `FILENAME` parameter when creating a secret.
The recommendation is to use an absolute path, not a relative one, and to store it in the `~/.duckdb` folder.
You will need to be able to access this file while querying GSheets (its content are not persisted. Later versions of this extension may enable that.)
Ex: `CREATE SECRET (TYPE gsheet, PROVIDER private_key, FILENAME '<path_to_JSON_file_with_private_key>');`

You can skip steps 10, 11, and 12 since this extension will convert from your JSON file to a token on your behalf!

Follow steps 13 and 14.

This private key by default will not expire. Use caution with it. 

This will also require an additional API request for every Google Sheets call, so it will take a small bit of extra time and you may want to use a token directly if you hit a rate limit of any kind.

## Limitations / Known Issues

- Google Sheets has a limit of 1,000,000 cells per spreadsheet.
- Reading sheets where data does not start in A1 is not yet supported.
- Writing data to a sheet starting from a cell other than A1 is not yet supported.
- Sheets must already exist to COPY TO them.
